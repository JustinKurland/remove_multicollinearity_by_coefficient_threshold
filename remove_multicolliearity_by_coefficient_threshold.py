def remove_multicollinearity_by_coefficient_threshold(df, method = 'spearman', coefficient_threshold = 0.7):
    """
    Uses the correlation between features and a specified threshold to 
    identify and remove collinear/multicollinear features.

    Args:
        df ([pandas.DataFrame]): 
            A dataframe that includes all the features that are being considered 
            for modeling without the target.
        method (str, optional): 
            spearman: Spearman rank correlation
            pearson : Pearson correlation coefficient
            kendall : Kendall Tau correlation coefficient
            Defaults to 'spearman'as it is less prone to false alarms and 
            tests if a monotonic relationship exists, however it is more 
            computationally expensive as it is non-parametric.
        correlation_threshold (float, optional): 
            Defaults to 0.7 as per the threshold established by Dormann, C. F., 
            J. Elith, S. Bacher, et al. 2013. Collinearity: a review of methods 
            to deal with it and a simulation study evaluating their performance. 
            Ecography 36:27â€“46.

    Returns:
        A Pandas Dataframe that has removed all collinear/multicollinear features from 
        the feature space based upon the correlation coefficient threshold.
